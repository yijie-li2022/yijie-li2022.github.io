I am a Master student majoring in `Artificial Intelligence` at Northwestern University. I have recieved my bachelor's degree (`Software Engineering`, dual degree program) from University College Dublin (UCD) and Beijing University of Technology(BJUT) in July 2023. 

I was a research intern at Tsinghua University in 2022~2023, focusing on generative adversarial networks (GAN), advised by Professor [Yongjin Liu](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm). Before that, I was working on several topics related to computer vision, supervised by Dr. [Soumyabrata Dev](https://soumyabrata.dev/) and Professor [Shaofan Wang](https://shaofanwang.weebly.com/) at UCD and BJUT.

My current researches focuses on accurate real-time salient object detection (SOD), application of computer vision in meteorology, and generative models. My research interests lies in remote sensensing, efficient segmentation and detection algorithms, image generation, image attribute manipulation, etc.
