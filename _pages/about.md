I am a graduate student majoring in `Artificial Intelligence` at Northwestern University. I received my Bachelor's degree (`Software Engineering`, dual degree program) from University College Dublin (UCD) and Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) in July 2023. 

I was a research intern at Tsinghua University in 2022~2023, focusing on generative adversarial networks (GAN), advised by Professor [Yongjin Liu](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm). Before that, I was working on several topics related to computer vision, supervised by Dr. [Soumyabrata Dev](https://soumyabrata.dev/) and Professor [Shaofan Wang](https://shaofanwang.weebly.com/) at UCD and BJUT.

My current research focuses on accurate real-time salient object detection (SOD), application of computer vision in meteorology, and generative models. My research interests lie in remote sensensing, efficient segmentation and detection algorithms, image generation, image attribute manipulation, etc.
